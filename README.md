# Overview of the analysis

average temperature is 71.04 degrees
the temperature ranges from 56-83 degrees
the temperature is 69 degrees or lower for about one week out of the month

# Summary
* With December being one of the coldest months of the year, we can see from the lower quartile and that temperatures range from 56-69 for about one week. Thats not too bad. The colder weather may drive sales for wetsuits and other related gear, which is good for business. However, ice cream sales may not be as rewarding.

* June presents almost the opposite with the hottest week of the month randing from 77 to 85 degrees. This is good for ice cream sales to cool those who may get uncomfortable in the higher temperatures.
